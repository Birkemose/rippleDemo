Very quick Cocos2D 2.0 conversion of the CCRipple demo forked from the author's Github page.

You will need to download and install the pre-built Cocos2D library over here:

https://github.com/Panajev/CocosLib

The suggested directory structure is the following one:

-CocosLib (downloaded from Github)
-SharedLibs (create it manually)
-Cocos2D_tests
--rippleDemo
